# Diabetes Prediction Web App

This is a web application that predicts the likelihood of a diabetes attack based on user-provided input. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on various health parameters and demographic information. Users can enter their gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease history, smoking history, BMI (Body Mass Index), HbA1c level, and blood glucose level to obtain a prediction.
